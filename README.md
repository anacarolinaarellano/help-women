## Purpose
Use the Twitter API to make a bot to which users that identify themselves as women can reach to if they suffer of domestic violence. The bot will ask for the location of the user and once it gets it, it will provide the information of a Mexican association that works within that state and helps women in those situations.

## About information retrieval
We will keep track of the number of users that have been helped by our bot and the cities in which it has had impact in order to display the statistics in the website. We also have a database that has the information about the associations, if they are not included they can reach to our website to provide their information and we'll reach back to them, verify them and add them to the database.

## The most important...
This project was developed with love and thinking in helping women. We think that everyone deserves a dignified life and we are glad that we can use our skills to develop something that can have such an impact. ðŸ’œ
